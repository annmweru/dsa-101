# 🧠 Relearning JavaScript & Mastering DSA

Welcome to my journey of going back to the basics — with intention, clarity, and commitment.

I’ve been a front-end developer working with Angular, but now I’m resetting and rebuilding my foundation in **core JavaScript** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** to improve my problem-solving, performance thinking, and technical confidence.

## 📍 Why This Repo Exists

After working with frameworks for years, I realized:
- I knew *how* to build, but not always *why* things work under the hood.
- I struggled with algorithm questions despite years of coding.
- I needed to **relearn core JavaScript deeply** — not just to pass interviews, but to become a truly confident engineer.

## 📚 Topics I'm Covering

### ✅ JavaScript – Core Foundation
- Variables (`let`, `const`, `var`)
- Data types
- Truthy & Falsy values
- Conditionals (`if`, `else`, ternary)
- Loops (`for`, `for...of`, `while`)
- Functions, parameters, scope & closures
- Objects & arrays
- DOM manipulation
- ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, etc.)

### ✅ DSA – The Problem Solving Side
- Big O Notation
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Hash Maps & Sets
- Recursion
- Sorting & Searching
- Trees & Graphs (basics)
- Problem patterns (sliding window, two pointers, etc.)
